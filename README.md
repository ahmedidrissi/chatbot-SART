# Chatbot SART
As part of the end-of-year project (PFA) as engineering students at ENSIAS, we chose to work on the implementation of a chatbot for a stock management application for a clothing store . Our project was to develop a chatbot, named "Chatbot SART - Style Assistant and Retail Technology", which was integrated into the application. This chatbot uses artificial intelligence, speech recognition, speech synthesis and natural language processing techniques to intuitively interact with users.
The main objective of this chatbot is to assist users with their stock management needs, by providing information on available products, stock levels, orders, etc.
